For whatever insane reason, brew encrypts mif files. Idk, maybe it was to try
and thwart people from pirating software? Honestly its not very good at that...

Anyway, on boot the kernel (or something) checks fs:/mif/ for any new mif files.

After finding a new one and doing its shenanigans, it encrypts it.

Thankfully the encryption is quite shit. Brew xor's the mif file with a key of
random values. How it generated the key is anyones guess!
